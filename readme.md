### Development

Want to contribute or make your own project? Great!

Both Controller and Model folders have sample files inside. 
Sample file gives you the basic usage template. 

To create a model, view or a controller, set the name of the file, to match the next template: **nameType**.php
  
Example:
**modelName**Model.php, **controllerName**Controller.php, **viewName**View.php

So if we want to make a /**test** page on our website, simply create:
**test**Model.php, **test**Controller.php, **test**View.php

Every model declares an **app** variable:
```php
global $app;
$app = new <modelName>();
```
Which is being called inside of our controller 
```php
$data = $app;
```
Controller works with our data and generates the page, by passing a view inside of the given template.

Controllers are being called from the **route.php** file, which is loading a controller based on the URL. 
**Page URL -> Controller Name**
